environments:
  # For each environment the env_name is required to make it.
  # Additional parameters (per environment) should be added after the env_name.
  # Example of additional parameter for CartPole Environment - render_mode: "rgb_array"
  cartpole:
    env_name: "CartPole-v1"

  mountaincar:
    env_name: "MountainCar-v0"

  acrobot:
    env_name: "Acrobot-v1"

## Maybe it should work the same way as environments (support multiple rather than a single one)?
#agent:
#  # "standard" → usual replay buffer DQN
#  # "adaptive" → adaptive-buffer variant
#  variant: "adaptive"
